                <p>My name is Keso Kareli, a future programmer. My programming career started when I was pursuing my favorite field. I liked some things, but then I got bored. I decided to try something new and tried programming. Today, it is my favorite field. I wouldn't have been able to achieve anything if I hadn't tried. But I managed to do it and today I am making this website.</p>
